## How to find the video_id üßë‚Äçüè´
```
Rumble does not provide an API or a functionality that allows me to fetch video id using the channel name
so you will have to do it this way:

Go to your live livestream
Click F12 or right click > Inspect
Click on the network tab and look for the GET request to wn0.rumble.com
```
